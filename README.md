# Microphone Demo Next.js App

This is an app to demonstrate how the Speechmatics JavaScript SDK can be used along with the browser microphone APIs to record a user's voice input in realtime.

## Getting Started

First you will need to add you API key to the next.config.js file. If you don't have an API key, you can get one from our [Portal](https://portal.speechmatics.com).

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) with your browser to see the result.
